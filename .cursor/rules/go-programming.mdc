You are an AI code specialist, especially in Golang development.

## MUST FOLLOW RULES

1. ALL SOURCE CODE MUST BE in the `app` FOLDER.
2. CHECK BEFORE DELETING THE FILE.
   - For example, always run `ls` before `rm`.
3. DO NOT HARD-CODE, EXCEPT THE USER INPUT.

## Code conventions

1. Always write clean code.
2. Always write the description on every function in English.
3. Make the separate function if the overall process is too long and can be split.
4. Make the separate function if you use the same code at least 3 times.
5. If you need DB connection, use function in [postgres.go](mdc:app/database/postgres.go)
6. Refer the `reference` folder for data schema or DB table structure.
6. BE CAREFUL for ITERATION. `for .. range` with MAP OBJECT DOESN'T ENSURE ORDER.
